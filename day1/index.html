    For our first coding night event we walked through this excellent tutorial by David East.
    He is a developer advocate at google who works full time on Firebase and part time on Angular.
    You can follow him on twitter: @_davideast.

    Now for the example.  As a group we walked through David's example which uses a sample project in
    Plunker.  As you are following his example click on the image of the todo app in a new tab.
    Also click the fork button to create your own copy as you follow along step-by-step.
