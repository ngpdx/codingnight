    <h3>Welcome to Coding Night</h3>
    <p>
        Our presentation nights have been very successful, and we have so many new members each month.  I have been getting
        feedback that talks are a bit too advanced.  We have been able to provide some introductory lightning talks with
        success, and the other side of that is that I wanted to provide something for people just getting started so that
        at some point they will be presenting topics for the group.
